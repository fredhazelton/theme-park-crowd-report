"""Challenger: xgb-dow

Hypothesis: Day-of-week as a 6th feature captures weekend/weekday crowd patterns
that the baseline misses. Weekends at WDW are consistently different from weekdays.

Changes from baseline:
- Add day_of_week (0=Mon, 6=Sun) as feature #6
- Everything else identical: same hyperparams, same geo-decay, same weighting
